# Project Plan: SEO Blog Generator

## Project Overview
The SEO Blog Generator is an AI-powered application designed to generate SEO-optimized blog content using the Gemini API. It aims to streamline the process of creating engaging and relevant blog posts by automating keyword, title, and content generation.

## Objectives
- Automate the generation of SEO keywords, titles, and blog content.
- Integrate with the Gemini API for content generation.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting topics and receiving generated content.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.
- **Frontend**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the Gemini API for generating content.
- **Routes**: Separate modules for handling keywords, titles, and content generation.

## Key Components
- **Server Setup**: Configured using Express, with middleware for validation and CORS.
- **Frontend Setup**: HTML, CSS, and jQuery files served by the Express server.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/generate/title`: Generates SEO titles.
  - `/api/generate/content`: Generates blog content.
  - `/api/generate/keywords`: Generates SEO keywords.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed using dotenv for API keys and configuration.

## Development Steps
1. Set up the Express server and configure middleware.
2. Implement route modules for keywords, titles, and content.
3. Integrate with the Gemini API for content generation.
4. Create and serve HTML, CSS, and jQuery files.
5. Test API endpoints for functionality and error handling.

## Testing Strategies
- Unit tests for route modules.
- Integration tests for API endpoints.
- Mock tests for Gemini API responses.

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure environment variables are correctly configured.
- Optimize server performance for handling API requests.
- Implement logging and monitoring for error tracking.
